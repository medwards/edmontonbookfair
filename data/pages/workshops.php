<h1>2008</h1>
<h2>Opening welcome for the 2008 Anarchist Bookfair</h2>
<p>Short history of the Association of United Ukrainian Canadians, and its tradition as a working class organization.<br />
by <i>Eugene Plawiuk</i>
<b>11:15 - 11:30</b></p>

<h2>When Workers Take Over</h2>
<p>This workshop will not be mere veneration of the struggle of Argentina’s recovered enterprises. Instead, the focus will be on extracting lessons from their experience and making concrete connections between the worker-controlled enterprises and our context here in Alberta. Rhiannon, utilizing some video and photos, will provide information about the context, history, and development of the worker run businesses and be available to answer questions. The objective of the workshop will be to have participants come away thinking about worker control not as a rusty discourse of the past, but rather as a vibrant and possible method of struggle for a better world.<br />

<h2>Direct Action on the Job followed by Know Your Rights</h2>
<p>by <i><a href="http://edmonton.iww.ca">IWW Edmonton GMB</a> and the <a href="http://swag.apirg.org">Student Worker Action group</a></i><br />
<b>1:30 - 3:30 pm<br />
Main Stage (behind the curtain)</b></p>

<h2>Gender and Organizing</h2>
<p>An experiential workshop and discussion on gender construction, how we experience/express gender and how this affects organizing particularly in anti-authoritarian or non-hierarchical communities.</p>
<p>Over the past half year a number of groups have organically come together to talk about gender roles and sexism within activist communities and organizing in Edmonton. These discussions have occurred in groups of various sizes and in both formal and informal settings. Thus far there has not been an opportunity for open, public, inclusive and facilitated discussion and exploration of these issues.</p>
<p>Workshop goals</p>
<ul>
	<li>to provide a forum for discussion and exploration</li>
	<li>to pool our collective knowledge on how gender construction, expression and experience affects each of us</li>
	<li>to build a toolbox of language and different ways for expressing the diversity of gender expression and experience</li>
	<li>to think about ways to incorporate our knowledge into our everyday interactions</li>
	<li>to formulate ways to continue to this dialogue</li>

<h2>Zines 101</h2>

<h2>Wobblies and Zapatistas: Conversations on Anarchism, Marxism and Radical History</h2>
<p>by <i>Andrej Grubacic (Professor of Sociology at the University of San Francisco)</i><br />
<b>3:30 - 5:30 pm<br />

<h2>WITHER MARXISM? AN INTERACTIVE ROLE-PLAY</h2>
<p>The "leaders" of our society today (and many self-described "anarchists") would have you believe that Marxism has long been consigned to the dustbin of history, being sufficiently discredited with the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1991. But are the works of Karl Marx really that irrelevant, or are there lessons we can still learn today?</p>
<p>This interactive workshop will briefly introduce participants to the basic tenets of Marx's Labour Theory of Value (LTV) and place them in a role-play situation simulating a typical work environment today. The direction of the workshop will depend almost entirely on those who attend, so if you want to see how 19th-century theory can still influence action today (and have some fun in the process), this workshop is for you!<br />

<h2>Radio as Activism – Becoming the Media</h2>
<p>Although getting in the corporate media is important to the progressive movement, utilizing underground and self-created media is important to spreading the message to underground movements in Edmonton and Canada.</p>
<p>CJSR offers training in recording your own events for broadcast over the CJSR airwaves, over the internet and across Canada.</p>
<p><b>Using the Media - "Why didn't they come out? I sent a press release."</b></p>
<p>This is a common phrase heard from advocacy groups. Learn how you can attract media to your event and develop media relations to ensure consistent coverage and create the message you're looking for.</p>
<p>This media workshop will work through the theory behind getting in the media and developing a message to work for your campaign all the way up to making the pitch call and writing the press release.</p>
<p>We run through a practice interview session and press scrum. Get to know the good, the bad and the ugly media.<br />
