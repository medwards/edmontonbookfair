<h3>Welcome to Edmonton!</h3>

<p>A city where the most dangerous weapon to those in power is knowledge, ideas and discussion. Anarchism draws on all of these things to advocate that we need not be content with the status quo, that positive change is possible, that we need not be slaves to economic or political masters. From this comes the concept of the Anarchist Bookfair, a place where knowledge and ideas are made available, especially those one might not encounter every day.</p>

<h3>Learn, Share, Connect!</h3>

<p>Since 2002 the Edmonton Anarchist Bookfair has provided the public with the opportunity to share ideas and connect with others over a free three-day event. Each year upwards of 1000 people are able to access radical books, see independent documentaries and participate in skill-share workshops. The event attracts vendors, speakers and participants from all over Western Canada and USA. We received very positive full-page articles in both of Edmonton's mainstream newspapers, reviews of our feature film presentation in both arts weekly magazines, and multiple interviews on independent radio stations.</p>
<h3>Bookfair 2009</h3>
<p>This year's Anarchist Bookfair will be taking place October 2-4, 2009 at the Edmonton Ukranian Center (<a href="finding_us.html">map and address</a>). We're looking forward to seeing you there!</p>
